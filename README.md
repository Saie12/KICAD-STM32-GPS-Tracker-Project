## Technical Deep Dive

### System Architecture

The hardware architecture is centered around the STM32 MCU, which acts as the brain of the system. It orchestrates all operations:

1.  **GPS Data Acquisition:** The MCU communicates with the GPS module (typically over a UART serial bus) to receive and parse standard NMEA sentences, extracting critical data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and time.
2.  **Cellular Modem Management:** The MCU controls the GSM module using AT commands sent over a second UART. It manages the SIM card connection, establishes a GPRS data session, and transmits formatted data packets (e.g., via HTTP or MQTT) to a configured backend server.
3.  **Power Management:** An on-board switching regulator efficiently steps down the 12V input to a stable 3.3V rail required by the MCU and other sensitive digital components.

### RF & PCB Design

Handling two separate RF systems on a compact board requires careful design considerations.

*   **RF Traces:** The traces connecting the GPS and GSM modules to their respective external antenna connectors (`GPS_ANT` and `GSM_ANT`) are designed as 50-ohm controlled impedance transmission lines. This is crucial for minimizing signal loss and maximizing RF performance.
*   **4-Layer PCB:** The design utilizes a 4-layer printed circuit board. This allows for dedicated signal, ground, and power layers, which is essential for:
    *   **Noise Reduction:** A solid ground plane provides excellent shielding and a low-inductance return path for high-speed signals, isolating the sensitive RF components from digital noise.
    *   **Signal Integrity:** Ensures clean, reliable communication between all components.
    *   **Compact Routing:** Enables a denser and more compact physical layout.

*   **Design Note:** For optimal RF performance and EMI/EMC compliance, the layer stackup should be configured as `Signal - Ground - Power - Signal`. Dedicating an entire inner layer to an uninterrupted ground plane is a best practice for mixed-signal RF designs like this one.

## Getting Started

To use this board, you will need:

1.  A **12V DC** power supply.
2.  An active **SIM card** with a data plan.
3.  External **GPS and GSM antennas** with appropriate connectors.
4.  An **ST-Link** or similar SWD programmer to flash the firmware onto the STM32 MCU.
5.  Custom firmware to read the GPS data, format it, and send it to your desired server endpoint via the GSM module.
